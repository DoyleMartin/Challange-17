# SocialSphere üß†

A full-stack social network API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** (via **Mongoose**), designed to support a minimal social media-style backend. It enables users to share thoughts, react to friends' posts, and manage a dynamic friend list‚Äîall while following RESTful conventions.

> ‚ö° Built using starter code from Module 17‚Äôs Mini Project of the Columbia Engineering Full-Stack Bootcamp.
